# 💫 About Me:
I'm a third-year Computer Science student at EPFL (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne).

I am currently working on [**AlgoHub**](https://github.com/AlgorithmsAcademy/AlgoHub) — an educational tool to document algorithms with structured templates, aiming to help people easily understand core algorithmic concepts and prepare for technical interviews.
